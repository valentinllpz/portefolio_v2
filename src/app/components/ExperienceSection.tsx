          My mission at Motto is to maintain and develop new features for the
          website, mobile application, operations management platform and API as
          part of a small agile technical team with shared responsibilities.
          <br />I work with React Native, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for the
          mobile app. For the website, I use NextJS, React, TypeScript, Tailwind
          CSS, and Headless CMS Sanity. The API is built using Ruby on Rails.

          I designed and developed a portfolio for an interior architect and TV
          set designer based on given assets. This was my first freelance
          project and I worked on it during my free time, in addition to my job
          at Motto. I used Figma to first create the websiteâ€™s design then
          developed it using NextJS, React, Typescript, Tailwind CSS.

          Prior to my career transition, I had 3 professional experiences in
          sales lasting 6 months each. These positions were focused on sales and
          business development.
